# My Portfolio Project

## Description
This project involved the creation of a webpage that would serve as my own personal portfolio of projects that I have already completed and those that will be completed in the future. I created this webpage in order to have a place to store projects that I am proud of and would like to show to others.  Additionally, the webpage was created without starter code in order to put into practice the HTML and CSS concepts that I have learned so far.  As I learn more about web development and create more projects utilizing new skills, this portfolio will become populated with these additional projects.

## Credits
I received a lot of help with the layout of my portfolio from Sangeetha Kaliaperu, a tutor with the Northwestern coding bootcamp.  She helped me organize my page into responsive rows using flex properties, rather than organizing sections using "float" commands and non-responsive sizing styles as I had begun to do.
